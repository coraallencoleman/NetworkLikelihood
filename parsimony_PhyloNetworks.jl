Compute the MP scores (one for each assignment of the blob root state)
given the descendants of a blob, conditional on the states at predefined parents
of hybrids in the blobs (one parent per hybrid) as described in
Leo Van Iersel, Mark Jones, Celine Scornavacca (2017).
Improved Maximum Parsimony Models for Phylogenetic Networks,
Systematic Biology,
(https://doi.org/10.1093/sysbio/syx094).
Assumes a set of state *guesses*, ie correct initialization of `w` for
predefined hybrid parents, and correct `fromBadDiamondI` field for the children
edges of these predefined parents. `fromBadDiamondI` is true for edges that are cut.
The field `isExtBadTriangle` is used to know which nodes are at the root of a blob.
The field `isChild1` is used (and assumed correct).
Field `inCycle` is assumed to store the # of detached parents (with guessed states)
- `nchar`: number of characters considered at internal lineages.
  For softwired parsimony, this is # states + 1, because characters
  at internal nodes are ∅, {1}, {2}, etc.
  For parental parsimony, this is 2^#states -1, because characters
  are all sets on {1,2,...} except for the empty set ∅.
- `costmatrix1`[i,j] and `costmatrix2`[k][i,j]: 2d array and vector of 2d arrays
  containing the cost of going to character j starting from character i
  when the end node has a single parent, or the cost of a child node
  having character j when its parents have characters k and i.
  These cost matrices are pre-computed depending on the parsimony criterion
  (softwired, hardwired, parental etc.)
used by [`parsimonyGF`](@ref).
